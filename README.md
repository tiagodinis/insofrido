Written & interactive poetry. Live at https://insofrido.com.

This was my first website. First time touching HTML, CSS and JS, and making something available online.

Use the simplest design I could think of, learned about responsiveness, and implemented animations and interactive experiences in css, js and the p5.js library.

There's a few unfinished sketches in the repo that will be reused on a future project, with all the webdev knowledge I have gathered since.
